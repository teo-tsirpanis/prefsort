[![AppVeyor](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/teo-tsirpanis/prefsort.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis/prefsort)

A program that sorts items, based on subjective criteria.

## What it is

Have you ever been in a situation where you have to rank things based on some criteria? And after you have done it, you realize that something is not right? This is so tedious to be done by a human. And that's where prefsort enters the game. It is great for making top-ten videos

## Usage guide for dummies ðŸ˜›

1. [Download](https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis/prefsort/releases) prefsort and extract it to a folder.

2. Open the file named `input.txt` and write at each line the items you want to rank.

__Example input file:__

```
One
Two
Three
Four
```

3. Run `prefsort.exe`. It will ask you, whether you prefer one item over another. If you have `n` items to rank, it will ask you about `n * log(n)` questions (log is the binary logarithm). You can answer by typing `1` or `2`.

4. When it finishes, check out `output.txt`

__Example output file:__

```
1: One
2: Two
3: Three
4: Four
```

## How it works

prefsort just sorts the items with a custom comparison function that asks the user which item is "bigger".

## Advanced use
